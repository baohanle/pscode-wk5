// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Ask for a number
Assign it to be variable x
Ask for another number
Assign it to be variable y
Add x and y as variable z
Print z

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Ask for a number
Assign it to be variable x
Take the modulus of x 
If this is 0, print "even"
Else print "odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)
Ask for a number
Assign to be variable a
Ask for another number
Assign to be variable b
Ask for another number
Assign to be variable c
Ask for another number
Assign to be variable d
Ask for another number
Assign to be variable e
Now we have a list of 5 numbers

b)
Add a+b+c+d+e and assign as "sum"
Divide sum by 5 and assign as "avg"
Print: The average is "avg"

c) 
Assign a to be "min" and "max"
For each number in this list of 5 numbers
compare the number with the previous min or max
If the number < min, assign it to be the new min
If the number > max, assign it to be the new max
Print: The minimimum is "min". The maximum is "max"
